## Data Science Demos

This repository serves as a public location to demonstrate my own personal data science projects. While the purpose
of this repo is to act as a personal portfolio, hopefully these projects will be useful and insightful in their
own right. Otherwise, what's the point!

So, that said, I hope you find these project interesting. Curretly these projects are IPython notebooks and
are located in the notebooks folder. Perhaps eventually there will be other platforms (e.g. I have some old R
projects lying around) but for now that's the plan.
